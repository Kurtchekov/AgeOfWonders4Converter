This requires Python 3 installed!

Put all files (run_me.sh or run_me.bat depending on whether you're using a linux system or windows, respectively) in the same folder as your empire/pantheon FILE resides, normally
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\[YOUR STEAM ID]\1669000\remote\Empire\[SOME UUID NUMBER]\. Then, run the "run_me" specific to your system.

This python script will append a header to your pantheon FILE and automatically generate a nice uuid name for it. 
Once it's done, you should get a new file in the same folder with a uuid name that resembles the format used in the GOG version of the game.
Move that file to C:/users/[YOUR USERNAME]/My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Age of Wonders 4/Storage/Empire/ and that should do the trick!

For now, only Steam -> GOG is supported, the other way around is coming soon!
